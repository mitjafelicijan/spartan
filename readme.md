## Why yet another UI kit?

Why develop yet another UI kit? Well the answer to this question is quite simple. I am disappointed every time I dedicate my time to new kit when so many extra functionalities are added that basically becomes unusable.

If I do frontend development I typically develop dashboards and some sort of backends. And I need something very minimal because I add up my own project specific styles on top of it. And I noticed that when I used other kits I spent most of my time rewriting already provided components just to satisfy my needs. With this project I am trying to take back control and providing minimal experience as possible so you can add your own styling on top of it and not be bothered with battling style inheritance. I only use !important with font-smoothing and nowhere else!
