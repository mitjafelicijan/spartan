## Why yet another UI kit?

Why develop yet another UI kit? Simply just to make my life easier. I usually need only some basic boilerplate kit and then I add styles accordingly. With this project I am trying to take back control by providing as minimal experience as possible so you can add your own styling on top of it and have clean interfaces that can be changed with couple of lines of code.
