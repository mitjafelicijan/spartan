## Why yet another UI kit?

Why develop yet another UI kit? Well the answer to this question is quite simple. I am disappointed every time I dedicate my time to new kit when so many extra functionalities are added that basically becomes unusable.

If I do frontend development I typically develop dashboards and some sort of backends. And I need something very minimal because I add up my own project specific styles on top of it. And I noticed that when I used other kits I spent most of my time rewriting already provided components just to satisfy my needs. With this project I am trying to take back control by providing as minimal experience as possible so you can add your own styling on top of it and not be bothered with battling style inheritance.
